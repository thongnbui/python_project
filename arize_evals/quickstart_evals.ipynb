The reference text does not provide an exact figure, only stating that it is over 13,000 miles. The answer provides a specific length that is not mentioned in the reference text.

However, the answer also claims that the Amazon rainforest is home to the largest number of plant and animal species in the world. This information is not mentioned in the reference text. The reference text only provides information about the size and location of the Amazon rainforest, not about the biodiversity or the number of species it contains.
