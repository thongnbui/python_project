Can you tell me a bit about what prompted you to seek therapy this time?\\nuser: CPTSD from my childhood. I don’t have regular PTSD like flashbacks and stuff. I am fundamentally fucked up because my brain was developed in a severely abusive home. My dad was physically, sexually, emotionally, and mentally abusive. I don’t struggle with accepting and moving on from the childhood trauma. I feel like my brain didn’t develop like it should have because the abuse started from the day I was born. I was raised in constant, consistent chaos. I feel like I’d be a much more healthy and emotionally stable young woman had I grown up in a healthy family. I can’t help but be jealous of that non existent version of me. These fundamental deeply rooted issues I have affect my daily life and relationships. I have lingering anxiety that I can’t pinpoint to a specific cause. I struggle with having sympathy. I struggle with patience. I’m defensive of myself. I get really angry for small reasons. I feel random devastation for no apparent reason at times. \\nassistant: I'm really sorry you're going through this.

Can you tell me a bit about what prompted you to seek therapy this time?\\nuser: CPTSD from my childhood. I don’t have regular PTSD like flashbacks and stuff. I am fundamentally fucked up because my brain was developed in a severely abusive home. My dad was physically, sexually, emotionally, and mentally abusive. I don’t struggle with accepting and moving on from the childhood trauma. I feel like my brain didn’t develop like it should have because the abuse started from the day I was born. I was raised in constant, consistent chaos. I feel like I’d be a much more healthy and emotionally stable young woman had I grown up in a healthy family. I can’t help but be jealous of that non existent version of me. These fundamental deeply rooted issues I have affect my daily life and relationships. I have lingering anxiety that I can’t pinpoint to a specific cause. I struggle with having sympathy. I struggle with patience. I’m defensive of myself. I get really angry for small reasons. I feel random devastation for no apparent reason at times. \\nassistant: I'm really sorry you're going through this. If you are not experiencing a life-threatening emergency, do you want to talk to a mental health professional about what you're going through?\\nObservations: Sexual Abuse\\nuser: Yes\\nassistant: Thank you for sharing that with me.
